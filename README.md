## Hi there 👋 I'm Steven!

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineering student at Rutgers University with a concentration in **Software Engineering**. I’m passionate about building intelligent applications that solve real-world problems — from AI-powered tools to full-stack web apps.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on **SmartChef**, an AI-powered recipe recommender using React, Node.js, TailwindCSS, and LLMs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and diving deeper into **LLM integration** and **agentic workflows**.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **consumer-focused apps**, **AI tools**, or **open-source projects** involving TypeScript or Python.
